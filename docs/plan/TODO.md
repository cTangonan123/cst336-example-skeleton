### Team Project Plan: Requirements
By now, your team should have selected a Team Coordinator. Only the Team Coordinator must submit this activity.
It should be about one to two pages.
Please, include:

1) The title of the project
2) A description of what your team plans to do for the final project.
Be as detailed as possible. Explain briefly how you plan to address each requirement (refer to the Final Project rubric located in Week 0).
3) Any issues your team might be experiencing with team mates (not responding, etc.)
4) If possible, list the roles that your teammates will be taken in the project development. All of you should be involved in coding at least a couple of functions, however, some of you might take a more active role in other areas such as: database development, quality assurance, styling and formatting, front-end programming, etc.
